All commands, queries of data transfer to (or from) Quickbooks occurs via preparing appropriate form of XML (Extended Markup Language) files which are passed to Quickbooks through Web Connector.<br>

Data synchronization is required to have most recent lists of QB data such as lists of items, customers, sales and purchase orders, estimates and payments. This data is necessary to correctly operate with the "web terminal".<br>

Example - if we change address, email or phone of the customer in Quickbooks we'll need to request "Customers synchronization" (on this page) that commands Quickbooks to execute that command and generate XML file containing all customers data residing in Quickbooks
