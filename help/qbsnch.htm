Data synchronization with Quickbooks is required each time the manual changes are made in the appropriate part of Quickbooks.<br><br>
It is required to have most recent lists of QB data such as lists of items, customers, sales and purchase orders, estimates and payments. Most recent data is necessary for Web Terminal to operate correctly.<br>
Example - if we change address, email or phone of the customer in Quickbooks we'll need to request "Customers synchronization" (on this page) that will create the appropriate query. 
After creating a query an application in the "Web Connector" should be updated/executed which commands Quickbooks to generate XML file containing all customers information.
